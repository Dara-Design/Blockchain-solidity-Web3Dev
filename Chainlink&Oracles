-we need to use decentralised Oracle Network to get the price of one Ether it terms of USD

-Blockchain Oracle: Any device that interacts with the off-chain world to provide external data or computation to smart contracts 

-decimals don't actually 'work well' in solidity

-Chainlink VRF -way to get get provably random numbers from the real world into our smart contracts

-Chainlink keepers- are way to do decentralized event driven computation

-You can send API request with smart contracts , but you need to make your own network, they don't come with decentralised oracle network
